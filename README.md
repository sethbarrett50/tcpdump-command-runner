# tcpdump-command-runner
A Python script that uses `tcpdump` to capture network traffic for a specified duration, runs custom commands during the capture, and saves the output to pcap files. This allows for capturing both the network traffic during the idle state and the traffic generated by the execution of the commands.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- tcpdump
Please ensure that you have `tcpdump` installed on your system. You can install it using the package manager for your distribution. For example, on Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install tcpdump`
## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/tcpdump-command-runner.git`
2. Edit the `commands` and `fileNames` lists in `tcpdump_command_runner.py` to include your desired commands and output pcap file names.
3. Run the script: `python3 tcpdump_command_runner.py`
The script will iterate through the commands and file names, running `tcpdump` for the specified duration (default is 8 hours) and executing each command during the capture. The captured network traffic, including the effects of the executed commands, will be saved to the corresponding pcap files.
## Customization
You can change the capture duration by modifying the `capture_duration` variable in `tcpdump_command_runner.py`. The default value is 8 hours (8 * 60 * 60 seconds). To change the duration, simply update the value to your desired duration in seconds.
